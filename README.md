- **[React developer/Sienna pastry bautique "e-commerce"]**: [As a Led Frontend Developer at an innovative startup within the food industry, my primary responsibility revolves around spearheading the design and development of the frontend using React.js. I collaborate closely with the client to understand their unique requirements, ensuring that our projects align with their vision and expectations. This involves meticulous project tracking to maintain transparency and deliver results in a timely manner. A key focus of my role is crafting user-centric products that prioritize speed, responsiveness, and an intuitive interface.
